				<h2>The Beginning</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 1.5vw;">We are so excited that you are interested in joining that special and distinctive community of Sigma Lambda Beta men.&nbsp; 
				<br><br>

				And we also want to acknowledge that joining a fraternal organization such as Sigma Lambda Beta is a significant decision in one’s life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of this it is important that you have as much information as possible so that you can make the best decision for yourself.&nbsp; It is imperative that you do your due diligence and learn about those fraternities that you believe are of interest to you.&nbsp;
